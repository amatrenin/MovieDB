<strong>The MovieDB is based on Kotlin, retrifit,pattern MVVM architecture.</strong>
<ui>
<br>
<br><b>Android Jetpack</b>

<li>Lifecycle An interface that automatically responds to lifecycle events. </li>

<li>LiveData Data objects that notify views of changes to the underlying database.</li>

<li>ViewModel Data related to the user interface that is not destroyed when the application is rotated. Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.</li>

<br><b>DI Hilt</b>
<li> Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the execution time of manual dependency injection into your project. Performing manual dependency injection requires that you create each class and its dependencies manually, and use containers to reuse and manage dependencies.</li>
<br><b>Image</b>
<br><br>
<li>Glide Image loading and caching library for Android, focused on smooth scrolling.</li>

<li>Picasso Picasso allows you to easily upload images to your app - often in a single line of code.</li>

<br><b>HTTP</b><br> 
<li>Retrofit2 Type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.</li>

<li>OkHttp HTTP + HTTP/2 client for Android and Java applications.</li>

<br><b>Coroutines</b>
<li>Kotlin Coroutines Coroutines is a rich library for coroutines developed by JetBrains. It contains a number of high-level primitives with support for coroutines, which are discussed in this guide, including startup, asynchrony, and others.</li>

<br><b>Fragment</b>

<li>A Fragment represents a reusable portion of your app's UI. A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input events. Fragments cannot live on their own--they must be hosted by an activity or another fragment.</li>

<br><b>Video Player</b>
<li>Youtube Player Android-Youtube-Player is a stable and customizable open source YouTube player for Android. It provides a simple view that can be easily integrated into each Activity/Fragment.</li>

<br><b>Firebase</b></br>
<li>Authentication lets you add an end-to-end identity solution to your app for easy user authentication, sign-in, and onboarding in just a few lines.</li>
</ui>

<br><b>Room</b></br>
<li>The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. In particular, Room provides the following benefits:</li>

<li>Compile-time verification of SQL queries.</li>
<li>Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.</li>
<li>Streamlined database migration paths.</li>


<br><b>Unit test</b></br>

<li>Local tests enable you to evaluate your app's logic more quickly. However, not being able to interact with the Android framework creates a limitation in the types of tests you can run.</li>

<li>A unit test verifies the behavior of a small section of code, the unit under test. It does so by executing that code and checking the result.</li>

<li>Unit tests are usually simple but their setup can be problematic when the unit under test is not designed with testability in mind.</li>

<br><b>Paging</b></br>
<li>The Paging Library helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time. Loading partial data on demand reduces usage of network bandwidth and system resources.</li>
